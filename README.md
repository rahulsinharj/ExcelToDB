## ExcelToDB
This **JAVA SPRING BOOT** project is taking excel file as input from api **/product/upload** and storing it in MySQL database with the help of implemented **Spring-JPA (Hibernate)**.
Also the stored data can be fetched and seen from api call **/product** with the help of implemented **Spring-DataRest (Rest API)**.

See the API controller code here [ProductAPIController](https://github.com/rahulsinharj/ExcelToDB/blob/master/LibApi/src/main/java/com/libapi/controller/ProductController.java)
